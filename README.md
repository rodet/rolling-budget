# Rolling Budget

This is a command-line based tool that can compute how much you spend during the
last four weeks on a rolling basis, instead of just taking the current month.
While this approach has some drawbacks (for example, it makes it harder to
budget big expenses), it allows to precisely control your budget, as it always show what you have spent in the last 4 weeks. That way, you don't have to be
at the end of the month to see that you've spent too much. You can control your
spending every day precisely.

The tools bases on CSV data, so this could be fed by a Dropbox-hosted file as
well. An example to the CSV data will be delivered as a template.

The code is still being finalized for release. Keep watching and thanks for
your interest.
