# Rolling Budget

This is a command-line based tool that can compute your budget on a rolling
basis, instead of just taking the current month. While this approach has some
drawbacks (for example, it makes it harder to budget big expenses), it
allows to precisely control your budget, as it always show what you have
spent in the last 4 weeks.

The tools bases on CSV data, so this could be fed by a Dropbox-hosted file as
well. An example to the CSV data will be delivered as a template.

The code is still being finalized for release. Keep watching and thanks for
your interest.
